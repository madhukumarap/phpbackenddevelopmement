PSR ->PHP STANDARED RECOMMANDEATION

composer is dependency and tools for over project

php is single inheritence languaes doesn'tsupoort multiple inheritence;
we can extends single class we can also extends multiple class using the interfcae or traits


traitswork as copy paste
->precedence method override when we define method in base class but  not override in child class

instead operator are use to solve the method confilct error 

anonomus class accpet argument thorugh class
in this we can use extends interfcae and traits as same as regular class


serialize object and method
it will serialize the properties and value  object and class it not serailizee the method

Key Concepts of Routing
Routes:

A route is a URL pattern that is associated with a specific function or piece of code in your application.
For example, if a user visits http://yourwebsite.com/about, the route /about would be mapped to a function that displays the "About Us" page.
Routing Table:

The routing table is a collection of routes. Each route consists of a URL pattern and the corresponding action (function) to execute.
The router checks the URL of the incoming request against this table to determine which function to execute.
Route Matching:

When a request comes in, the router will try to match the request's URL to one of the routes in its routing table.
If a match is found, the corresponding action is executed. If no match is found, the router typically returns a 404 error.
