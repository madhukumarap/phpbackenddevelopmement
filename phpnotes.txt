PSR ->PHP STANDARED RECOMMANDEATION

composer is dependency and tools for over project

php is single inheritence languaes doesn'tsupoort multiple inheritence;
we can extends single class we can also extends multiple class using the interfcae or traits


traitswork as copy paste
->precedence method override when we define method in base class but  not override in child class

instead operator are use to solve the method confilct error 

anonomus class accpet argument thorugh class
in this we can use extends interfcae and traits as same as regular class
